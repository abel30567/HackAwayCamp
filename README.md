# HackShackRoboRanks

Made by Claudio Atilano

This is to help the students compete with one another to know where each student ranks amongst each other.
Great experience, learned how to code HTML using Javascript,
how to call functions onclick and onload

NEED TO CHANGE THAT CHECKBOX BUT IF I STYLE IT IT GOES AWAY!
